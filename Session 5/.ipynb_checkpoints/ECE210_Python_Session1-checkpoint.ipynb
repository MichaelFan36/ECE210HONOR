It is remarkably powerful and for advanced figures, with subplots, insets and other components. note that python also has a MATLAB-style API called pylab that it is easy to get started with if you are familiar with MATLAB but I'd encourage not to use the MATLAB compatible API for anything but the simplest figures."
